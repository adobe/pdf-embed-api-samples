### Local PDF file Preview

This sample demonstrates how to render a local PDF file using the PDF Embed API. It will ask you to pick a PDF file from your computer to start the PDF file rendering using the PDF Embed API.

### PDF Preview with Annotation tools

PDF viewer will render PDF file along with annotation tools enabled.
To see it in action, copy the files in the ```More Samples/PDF Annotations``` folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.

Note that by default if a user saves the PDF file after adding comments, the file is downloaded locally. This sample shows how to change that behavior, in this case taking no action except adding a small delay.

### PDF Preview with Annotation APIs

PDF viewer will render PDF file along with annotation tools and APIs enabled.
These samples show how to use annotation APIs to add, import, export, update and delete annotations programmatically.
To see it in action, copy ```More Samples/PDF Annotations APIs``` folder to your computer, and try it out in a supported browser.

### PDF Preview with Events

This sample shows how to start receiving events from PDF viewer.
To see it in action, copy the files in the ```More Samples/Capture PDF Embed API Events``` folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.

### Handle Search Engine Indexing

These samples provide different implementations of how to enable indexing of PDF files displayed using PDF Embed API.
